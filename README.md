##### :clock1130: Date:

March 2022

##### :muscle: What was my motivation?

I wanted to try out Backend and understand how it generally is connected with Frontend.

##### :books: What did I learn?

How to create a server, how to use MongoDB, what is Node.js and Express and how JS is compiled. This project also let me dive into React and use different array methods.

##### :flashlight: How to use the project?

Check it here:

<br>
This project has been deployed in Heroku and Netlify as a monorepo so it might take some time to load. You can add sneakers to favourites, add them to cart and send your order. Cards are fetched from MongoDB. Favourites, cart and orders are also stored in MongoDB.
<br>
Or open the code in your fav editor, change directory to mongodb folder in terminal by using **cd mongodb** on Windows and run **npm run dev**. Then open another terminal and change directory to the frontend folder, then run the react app using **npm start**.
